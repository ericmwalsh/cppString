STUDENT NAME :: ERIC M WALSH

NOTES:  I did not include a makefile because I did not have time.

I have three files:
- MyString.h (Header file) - I added two new methods for testing purposes.
- MyString.cpp (Source file)
- testMyString.cpp (this file is used to test MyString - I have written multiple methods with console input detailing testing)
